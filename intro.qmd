------------------------------------------------------------------------

I am a senior research associate at the [University of Georgia](https://www.uga.edu), specializing in leveraging mathematical skills to address complex problems in biological and environmental settings. My research focus cut across numerical analysis, mathematical biology, molecular epidemiology, financial mathematics, dynamical systems, machine learning and climate risk modeling.

I completed my PhD as a researcher at the [EPSRC Centre for Doctoral Training in Statistical Applied Mathematics](https://www.samba.ac.uk) at the [University of Bath](https://www.bath.ac.uk). My doctoral work focused on analyzing time-delayed systems to investigate the effects of climate change on agriculture. Specifically, I developed both mathematical and statistical models to explore how time lags between flowering and harvesting stages affect cocoa crops, to predict their behavior as global temperatures rise.

Before embarking on my PhD, I earned multiple master’s degrees in various areas of mathematical sciences. During my time as an [African Union Commission](https://www.au.int/en/directorates/education) scholar at the Pan African University, I developed novel numerical approaches for pricing exotic options, with a particular focus on barrier options. I am also an alumnus of the [African Institute for Mathematical Sciences (AIMS)](https://www.aims.ac.za/about-aims-south-africa), a leading institution for mathematically talented African students, as part of the Next Einstein Initiative. In addition, I had the honor of participating in the [Heidelberg Laureate Forum](https://www.Heidelberg-Laureate-Forum.org/about-us/) which is exclusive gathering of  most promising young researchers and renowned laureates.

My academic journey began in Nigeria, where I graduated with first class honors in my bachelor’s program and earned a distinction in my MSc degree in Mathematics, both from the [University of Ilorin](https://www.unilorin.edu.ng/about-us/our-core-values).
