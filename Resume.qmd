## Professional Summary

I am a mathematician who brings both theoretical depth and practical experience to quantitative finance. My career began in the financial industry, where I worked as an analyst in banking and consulting. That early exposure to real-world investment challenges led me to pursue advanced academic training, ultimately earning a PhD in Mathematical Sciences. I specialize in applying mathematics alongside programming tools such as Python to build models for asset pricing, portfolio optimization, and financial risk analysis. I have also developed scalable, data-driven solutions that integrate machine learning and statistical modeling. My experience cut across both academic research and industry application, which gives me a unique ability to translate complex theory into tools that inform strategy, uncover patterns, and support sound investment decisions. After several years in research, I am now open to returning to the industry and applying my knowledge in a practical, high-impact setting where I can help teams solve complex financial problems and drive strategic outcomes.
